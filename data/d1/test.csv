Q Type your question-
magnetic field shows that the atoms
must have magnetic moment. However,
the moment cannot be due to the orbital
angular momentum since \( \varphi=0 . \) Hence
one must assume existence of intrinsic
angular momentum, which as the experiment shows, has only two permitted orientations. Spin of the electron produces angular momentum equal to \( s=\sqrt{s(s+1)} \frac{h}{2 \pi} \)
where \( s=+\frac{1}{2} \)
Total spin of an atom \( =+\frac{n}{2} o r-\frac{n}{2} \)

The Substance which contain species

\( Q \)
more steeply for positive \( V \) than at higher temperatures, and at successively higher temperatures the asymmetry in the curve becomes less and less pronounced. The current - - voltage relation for a source may also be represented graphically. For a source represented by \( \boldsymbol{V}_{a b}=\boldsymbol{E}-\boldsymbol{I} \boldsymbol{r}, \) that is, \( \boldsymbol{V}=\boldsymbol{E}-\boldsymbol{I} r, \) The
graph appears in Figure (b). The ntercept on the \( V \) -axis, corresponding to the open circuit condition \( (\boldsymbol{I}=\mathbf{0}) \), is
at \( V=E \), and the intercept on the \( I \) -
axis, corresponding to a short-circuit situation \( (V=0), \) is at \( I=\frac{E}{r} \)
This relation may be used to find the current in a circuit containing a non linear device, as in fig (c). Its current voltage relation is shown in fig \( (d) \) and terminal voltage \( V=E-I r \) is also
plotted on this graph, each curve represents a current-voltage relation that must be satisfied, so the
ntersection represents the only possible values of \( V \) and \( I \). This amounts to a graphical solution of two simultaneous equation of \( V \) and \( I \), one of which is nonlinear.

When a device has a nonlinear voltage\( V \)
current relation, the quantity \( \frac{-}{I} \) is not constant. This ratio may still be called resistance, but now it varies with current; it is constant only for a device obeying Ohm's law. Often a more useful quantity is \( \frac{d V}{d I}, \) which expresses the relation between a small change in current and the resulting voltage change. This is called dynamic or incremental resistance. Which of the following vacuum tube devices shows negative resistance?
