Q Type your question-
magnetic field shows that the atoms
must have magnetic moment. However,
the moment cannot be due to the orbital
angular momentum since \( \varphi=0 . \) Hence
one must assume existence of intrinsic
angular momentum, which as the experiment shows, has only two permitted orientations. Spin of the electron produces angular momentum equal to \( s=\sqrt{s(s+1)} \frac{h}{2 \pi} \)
where \( s=+\frac{1}{2} \)
Total spin of an atom \( =+\frac{n}{2} o r-\frac{n}{2} \)
where \( n \) is the number of unpaired
electron
The Substance which contain species
with unpaired electrons in their orbitals
behave as paramagnetic substances.
The paramagnetism is expressed in terms of magnetic moment. The magnetic moment of an atom \( \boldsymbol{\mu}=\sqrt{\boldsymbol{s}(\boldsymbol{s}+\mathbf{1})} \frac{e h}{2 \pi \boldsymbol{m} c}=\sqrt{\frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)} \frac{e h}{2 \pi m c} \)
\( s=\frac{n}{2} \)

When the fan runs at full speed, its speed becomes constant. This is because the torque due to magnetic field inside the fan is balanced by the torque due to air resistance on the
blades of the fan and the torque due to friction between the fixed part and the shaft of the fan. The electric power going into the fan is spent (i) in the internal resistance as heat, call it \( P_{1}, \) (ii) in doing work against internal friction and air resistance producing heat, sound,
etc., call it \( P_{2} \). When the coil of fan
rotates, an emf is also induced in the coil. This opposes the external emf is also induced in the coil. This opposes
the external emf applied to send the current to the fan. This emf is called
back emf, call it \( e . \) Answer the following questions when the fan is running at full speed.The current flowing into the

more steeply for positive \( V \) than at higher temperatures, and at successively higher temperatures the asymmetry in the curve becomes less and less pronounced. The current - - voltage relation for a source may also be represented graphically. For a source represented by \( \boldsymbol{V}_{a b}=\boldsymbol{E}-\boldsymbol{I} \boldsymbol{r}, \) that is, \( \boldsymbol{V}=\boldsymbol{E}-\boldsymbol{I} r, \) The
graph appears in Figure (b). The ntercept on the \( V \) -axis, corresponding to the open circuit condition \( (\boldsymbol{I}=\mathbf{0}) \), is
at \( V=E \), and the intercept on the \( I \) -
axis, corresponding to a short-circuit situation \( (V=0), \) is at \( I=\frac{E}{r} \)
This relation may be used to find the current in a circuit containing a non linear device, as in fig (c). Its current voltage relation is shown in fig \( (d) \) and terminal voltage \( V=E-I r \) is also
plotted on this graph, each curve represents a current-voltage relation that must be satisfied, so the
ntersection represents the only possible values of \( V \) and \( I \). This amounts to a graphical solution of two simultaneous equation of \( V \) and \( I \), one of which is nonlinear.

When a device has a nonlinear voltage\( V \)
current relation, the quantity \( \frac{-}{I} \) is not constant. This ratio may still be called resistance, but now it varies with current; it is constant only for a device obeying Ohm's law. Often a more useful quantity is \( \frac{d V}{d I}, \) which expresses the relation between a small change in current and the resulting voltage change. This is called dynamic or incremental resistance. Which of the following vacuum tube devices shows negative resistance?
